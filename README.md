# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Challenge Overview 

This challenge applies machine learning to a real world challenge-- predicting credit card risk. This is useful for determining good candidates for a loan, which can lead to lower default rates as well as provide more reliable experience. 

**The supervised machine learning models used were:**

* Na√Øve Random Oversampling
* SMOTE Oversampling
* Cluster Centroids Undersampling
* SMOTEENN Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier
* Easy Ensemble ADABoost Classifier

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
